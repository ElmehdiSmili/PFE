It is true that the onus of proving the facts essential to the establishment of the charge against an accused lies upon the prosecution and the evidence must be such as to exclude every reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused.
An accused cannot be convicted of an offence on the basis of conjectures or suspicions.
If a reasonable doubt arises in the mind of the Court after taking into consideration the entire material before it regarding the complicity of the accused the benefit of such doubt should be given to the accused but the reasonable doubt should be a real and substantial one and a 'well founded actual doubt arising out of the evidence existing after consideration of all the evidence'.
"Hence a mere whim or a surmise or suspicion furnishes an insufficient foundation upon which to raise a reasonable doubt, and so a vague conjecture, whimsical or vague doubt, a capricious and speculative doubt, an arbitrary, imaginary, fanciful, uncertain chimerical, trivial, indefinite or a mere possible doubt is not a reasonable doubt.
Neither is a desire for more evidence of guilt, a capricious doubt or misgiving suggested by an ingenious counsel or arising from a merciful disposition or kindly feeling towards a prisoner, or from sympathy for him or his family" (See Woodroffe & Ameer Ali's Law of Evidence, 13th Edn. Vol.I pp. 203-204).
It is well known that persons who are goldsmiths by profession are able to find out whether a piece of metal is gold or not by the colour of the streak produced by rubbing it on a touch-stone used by them even though their assessment of its purity may not be exact.
It may not be a scientific way of proving that the metallic bars were gold bars.
Its observations at pp 182-183 of the Report are as follows:
"Order 21, rule 72 21.36. With reference to Order 21, rule 72, a point was considered in the earlier Report.
A recommendation had been made in the Fourteenth Report to the effect, that a decree-holder should be allowed to purchase property unless the court has prohibited him from doing so.
The object of the recommendation was to avoid the delay that is frequently caused when the warrant of sale is returned unexecuted in the absence of bidders.
An amendment carrying out this recommendation was proposed in the draft Report on the Code which had been circulated.
Comments received thereon, however, emphasised the need for the court being aware of any proposal by the decree holder to bid.
The earlier Commission thought that there was force in this approach and a decision was taken not to disturb the existing rule.
We have considered this matter further, and have come to the conclusion that the approach in the earlier Report on the Code was correct.
Hence no change is recommended.
Order 21, rule 72 23 21. 36-A.
We have considered the more fundamental question if rule 72 should be retained at all.
The object behind this provision is to ensure fairness in the auction.
The decree holder, if interested in purchasing the property himself, can conceivably, keep back or discourage (or even mislead) prospective purchasers.
Ordinarily, the fetching of a higher purchase price would be in his interest (as likely to satisfy his claim without further execution).
But it should not be forgotten that when he is the purchaser this consideration takes leave, and he like every purchaser would like the price to be low.
To a certain extent, he has a hand in initiating, the sale, though not so in theory.
It is he who obtains the proclamation of sale; and, though the rules in Order 21 do not so require, it is he who is expected to assist, and even to guide, the process serving staff in various matters concerning execution e.g., affixation of the proclamation etc. He also estimates the price. For these reasons, it is better to keep the existing safeguard.

 was observed :
" In between the domains occupied respectively by questions of fact and of law, there is a large area in which both these questions run into each other, forming so to say, enclaves within each other. The questions that arise for determination in that area are known as mixed questions of law and fact. These questions involve first the ascertainment of facts on the evidence adduced and then a determination of the rights of the parties on an application of the appropriate principles of law to the facts ascertained.
18. The law was thus summed up :
(1) When the point for determination is a pure question of law such as construction of a statute or document of title, the decision of the Tribunal is open to reference to the court under s. 66 (1).
(2) When the point for determination is a mixed question of law and fact, while the finding of the Tribunal on the facts found is final its decision as to the legal effect of that finding is a question of law which can be reviewed by the court.
(3) A finding on a question of fact is open to attack under s. 66 (1) as erroneous in law if there is no evidence to support it or if it is perverse.
(4) When the finding is one of fact, the fact that it is itself an inference from other basic facts will not alter its character as one of fact.
19. In the instant case the Appellate Tribunal in its appellate order has set out the amount of profits made by the assessee company in the years of assessment 1943-44 to 1948-49. It has also mentioned the inconsistent positions taken up by the assessee in first claiming to be a dealer and then to be an investor which according to the Tribunal was due to the fact that it was incurring losses in the earlier years and had begun making profits when the claim of being an investor was put forward. But the two basic facts on which the Tribunal has based its findings are:
(1) the objects set out in the memorandum of association of the assessee company;
(2) the previous assertion by the assessee company that it was a dealer in investments and not merely an investor. Counsel for the assessee relies on the decision of Kishan Prasad & Co., Ltd. v. Commissioner of Incometax, Punjab [1955] 27 I.T.R. 49) 1954 Indlaw SC 88 where this Court held that the circumstance whether a transaction is or is not within the powers of the company has no bearing on the nature of the transaction or on the question whether the profits arising there from are capital or revenue income and, therefore, it is contended that the Tribunal has relied upon an irrelevant circumstance. Counsel for Revenue on the other hand refer to the judgment in Lakshminarayan Ram Gopal v. Government of Hyderabad [1955] I.S.C.R. 393) 1954 Indlaw SC 80 where the objects of an incorporated company were held not to be conclusive but relevant for the purpose of determining the nature and scope of its activities. Merely because the company has within its objects the dealing in investment in shares does not give to it the characteristics of a dealer in shares. But if other circumstances are proved it may be a relevant consideration for the purpose of determining the nature of activities of an assessee. Whether in the instant case it will have any relevance because of other materials on which the assessee company was relying in support of its case that it was merely an investor and not a dealer will have to be considered when the suggested questions of law are answered. As to what are the characteristics of the business of dealing in shares or that of an investor is a mixed question of fact and law. What is the legal effect of the facts found by the Tribunal and whether as a result the assessee can be termed a dealer or an investor is itself a question of law.
32. Under our jurisprudence the Government is not exempt from liability to, carry out the representation made by it as to its future conduct and it cannot on some undefined and undisclosed ground of necessity or expediency fail to carry out the promise, solemnly made by it, nor claim to be the judge of its own obligation to the citizen on an ex parte appraisement of the circumstances. in which the obligation has arisen. We agree with the High Court that the impugned order passed by the Textile Commissioner and confirmed by the Central Government imposing cut in the import entitlement by the respondents should be set aside and quashed and that the Textile Commissioner and the Joint Chief Controller of Imports and Exports be directed to issue to the respondents import certificates for the total amount equal to 100% of the f.o.b. value of the goods exported by them, unless there is some decision which fails within cl. 10 of the Scheme in questio
It was somewhat faintly urged that if the Government is held bound by every representation made by it regarding its intention. When the exporters have acted in the manner they were invited to act, the Government would be held bound by a contractual obligation even though no formal contract in the manner required by Art. 299 of the Constitution was executed, and the exporter would be entitled to claim damages contrary to that provision for breach of the contract even though no formal written contract had been executed in the manner provided by that Article. But the respondents are not seeking to enforce any contractual fight they are seeking to enforce compliance with the obligation which is laid upon the Textile Commissioner by the terms of the Scheme, and we are of the view that even if the Scheme is executive in character, the respondents who were aggrieved because of the failure to carry out the terms of the Scheme were entitled to seek resort to the Court and claim that the obligation imposed upon the Textile Commissioner by the Scheme be ordered to be carried out.
 In any event all these factors were considered by the Court of Small Causes bearing in mind the correct legal principles. The High Court on a reappraisal of these very evidence came to the conclusion that the partnerships were camouflages and were not acted upon and in fact and in reality the partnership firm was a sub-tenant of the appellant herein.
