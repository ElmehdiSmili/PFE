# Supervised summarization algorithms

We apply two types of supervised algorithms:
* Domain-independent (Pointer-generator)
* Legal domain-specific (Graphical Model, LetSum)

## Generated summaries

For the document [sample input.txt](../sample%20input.txt), we describe the summaries generated by each of the methods.

### Pointer-generator

```
$ python parseForExtract.py # for generating the input data for decoding process
$ python make_datafiles_2.py data_dir num_of_datafiles # for generating .bin files to be inputted to model and creating the vocab
$ python run_summarization.py --mode=decode --single_pass=True --data_path=/path/to/chunked/test_* --vocab_path=/path/to/vocab --log_root=/path/to/a/log/directory --exp_name=myexperiment

### Graphical Model

>>> import graphicalModel
>>> graphicalModel.get_summary('sample input.txt')
'Where any such claim is made, an assessment shall be made on the basis of the 
income, profits and gains of the said period, and, if an amount of tax has 
already been paid in respect of the income, profits and gains of the previous 
year exceeding the amount payable on the basis of such assessment, a refund 
shall be given of the difference."\n\nThe section does not regard a mere 
change in the personnel of the partners as amounting to succession and 
disregards such a change.In our opinion, this contention is without force.
 It upheld the view taken by the Tribunal.The Tribunal took the view that 
for purposes of income tax the firm was to be regarded as having a separate 
juristic existence apart from the partners carrying on the business and that 
the firm could be carried on even if there was a change in its constitution.\n
It was contended before us that the construction placed by the High Court upon 
section 25(4) of the Act was erroneous and was not warranted by the language of
 the section and that by reason of the change in the composition of the firm 
the same firm did not continue throughout and hence there was no right to 
relief under section 25(4) of the Act in the changed firm.On appeal to the 
Income-tax Tribunal, this decision was reversed and relief was granted to the 
applicant under section 25(4).\nIt was not disputed before the Tribunal that 
the business of the partnership firm of A. W. Figgies & Co. continued as tea 
brokers right from its inception till the time it was succeeded by the limited 
company.The name of the firm was A. W. Figgies & Co., and its\' business was 
that of tea brokers.\nIn 1939 Hillman was brought in and the partnership 
consisted of these three partners.There was a provision in the partnership 
deed of 1939 that on the retirement of any partner the partnership would not 
be determined but would be carried on by the remaining partners.\nFrom the 
statement of the case it does not appear that apart from the mere change in the
 personnel of the partners and in their respective shares there was any actual 
 dissolution of the firm, and any division of its assets and liabilities or a 
 succession to its business by any outside person.\n'
