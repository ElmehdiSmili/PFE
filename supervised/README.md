# Supervised summarization algorithms

We apply two types of supervised algorithms:
* Legal domain-independent (Pointer-generator)
* Legal domain-specific (Graphical Model, LetSum)

## Generated summaries

For the document [sample input.txt](../sample%20input.txt), we describe the summaries generated by each of the methods.

### Graphical Model

```py
$ python
>>> import rouge_crf
>>> rouge_crf.get_summary('sample input.txt')
'Where any such claim is made, an assessment shall be made on the basis of the income, profits and gains of the said period, and, if an amount of tax has already been paid in respect of the income, profits and gains of the previous year exceeding the amount payable on the basis of such assessment, a refund shall be given of the difference."\n\nThe section does not regard a mere change in the personnel of the partners as amounting to succession and disregards such a change.In our opinion, this contention is without force.\nIt upheld the view taken by the Tribunal.The Tribunal took the view that for purposes of income tax the firm was to be regarded as having a separate juristic existence apart from the partners carrying on the business and that the firm could be carried on even if there was a change in its constitution.\nIt was contended before us that the construction placed by the High Court upon section 25(4) of the Act was erroneous and was not warranted by the language of the section and that by reason of the change in the composition of the firm the same firm did not continue throughout and hence there was no right to relief under section 25(4) of the Act in the changed firm.On appeal to the Income-tax Tribunal, this decision was reversed and relief was granted to the applicant under section 25(4).\nIt was not disputed before the Tribunal that the business of the partnership firm of A. W. Figgies & Co. continued as tea brokers right from its inception till the time it was succeeded by the limited company.The name of the firm was A. W. Figgies & Co., and its\' business was that of tea brokers.\nIn 1939 Hillman was brought in and the partnership consisted of these three partners.There was a provision in the partnership deed of 1939 that on the retirement of any partner the partnership would not be determined but would be carried on by the remaining partners.\nFrom the statement of the case it does not appear that apart from the mere change in the personnel of the partners and in their respective shares there was any actual dissolution of the firm, and any division of its assets and liabilities or a succession to its business by any outside person.\n'
